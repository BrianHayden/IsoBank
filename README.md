# IsoBank
#IsoBank is a data repository for stable isotope ecologists. 
#It contains stable isotope rations of plants, animals and inorganic materials along with relevant metadata.

#This GItHub page is a focal point for a collaboration of ecologists and data scientists working to create, 
#refine and apply IsoBank to further ecological knowledge.
